        "thoughts": "Ran 4:18 (4:37 mile). Got out well in 65 right behind Addy and Ty. Then the next lap still felt pretty hard, but Addy and I ran a fucking 72. Changed gears pretty hard and tried to catch Ty. Still ran pretty slow for the last 700m despite feeling like I was really hauling.",
        "positives": "Confident and smooth and relaxed early.\nResponded well and stayed engaged on the second half extremely well.\n\nI should have moved up a lot earlier when I started to feel a little too good in the second lap.",
        "goal": "Well the goal was sub4:10, but given Ty ran 4:16 I think this was a really good effort for me. First time beating Addy since our first race ever together. I'm in really good shape right now",
