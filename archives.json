We obliged and clicked off 77s with him for a good chunk. After about a mile and a half, he got antsy and took off. That was not a move that Jacob or I wanted to make, so we said goodbye. We came through halfway at 16:07, which was right where I wanted to be. This was where Jacob took it from me, and he dropped the pace to 76s. Poifect. We started eating guys up in the second half. Every guy we past gave Jacob and I little more energy. Finally, with 6 to go, Jacob had had enough. He took off from me, dropping the pace even lower. I couldn't handle that at this point in the race. So I clung to the backs of the guys in front of me. My pace suffered a little bit, but not substantially.

Then the pack started to string out a bit and I was fighting a lot to keep pace lot. 3 guys from the back. I knew if I got to the back of the pack it was going to be mentally harder, so I went to move around a few people on the backstretch. I tucked in again to just hold on. I started to go out the back, so I made hard move to stay on, but I just couldn't sustain long once I got there . The guy ahead of me made a move and suddenly I was just in no man's land.

Got out aggressively to get right in behind Caleb and Noah. When Noah slipped back a bit on the 3rd curve, I filled the gap and kept pushing on Caleb. Then I started to feel really good with 700m to go, so I tried to go around Caleb, but he responded before I could really do anything, then I had to chase him down again and never caught back up. I definitely had a chance to make another hard move with 500m to go because Caleb slowed down a bit, but I wasn't confident enough to take that because I was worried about finishing. Noah caught me with 100m to go, and couldn't really respond, then Charlie came with 50m to go, and I dug really hard for that final gear and was able to nick him at the line for 3rd.","positives":"Positive 1: I prepared very well mentally and was ready to go out hard, so I was ready to just move onto Caleb's shoulder when the opportunity arose.\n\nPositive 2: Had a lot more confidence this race.

And them and the water barriers will get way beet as the season progresses. The legs aren't used to the race yet, but I fought. There were plenty of negative thoughts that tried to creep in, especially as the legs started to drag and Leb got farther away, but I just kept grinding. Kept taking the pain and moving forward. I'm ready to hurt, ready to grind and I'm so excited for the rest of season.","positives":"Positive 1: My hurdles got better as it went.

I had a good feeling that the race was gonna go out hard, and it did. I did my best to hang back and take it easy while maintaining solid contact on the pack. This did mean that I was out in 4:50 which is a little quick for me right now. Most of my teammates were out much, much faster, with big Klaasen being the next guy ahead of me being out in 4:47. Eventually the pack I was with realized that this pace was just too hot for them and came back to me. I then was running with three others: the moose caboose Jason Klaasen, an Aquinas duderino, and some jamoke from SHU. I went around them and they latched onto me, which I was not really too upset about because having people chasing you is better than having nobody at all. After another lap the Aquinas duderino took it from me which initially I was pretty happy about because I thought that it meant I was going to be able to settle in on his pace. Jason moved up next to me too, which again, I was pleased with. He looked like he wanted to take it back from the Aquinas guy but I grunted or did some sort of gesture to him trying to convey that I thought it would be wisest for us to sit on this guy if he was gonna do the work. The moose understood. Shortly after coming to this understanding the Aquinas guy started to slow down. It was very perceptible to me, and I tried to convey this to Jason but to no avail. I was not trapped in the awkward spot of being between the outside trail leg of the Aquinas guy and the loping stride of the moose. After probably only 50m of contemplation, I gave the moose a gentle nudge signifying my presence and intentions. I was a little nervous about jumping out in front of Jason because he has a long stride and I did not want either of us to get tangled up (especially after witnessing the calamity of Vreeke's spill at spring break). Fortunately I was able to slip pas him and back out around the Aquinas guy to re-assume the lead of my pack. At this point there was now at least a 50m gap between myself and the next runner up, which was Jacob. He looked like was hurting, I could see it in his form. In hindsight, this was where the race decision needed to be made. I had two options in retrospect: make a hard move and remove myself from my comfort zone to try to go up to Jacob in only a lap or two, or make an easier move to try to drag Jason along with me up to Jacob over the course of a few more laps. I chose the second option, and I now wish I hadn't. What happened was this: for the remainder of the race Jason and I would trade the lead trying to slowly creep up to Jacob. Every time Jason took the lead from me I could feel the pace slow down, and I needed to take it back from him after only a lap or so. Every time I took the lead, I am sure that Jason felt like it was slowing down, so he would take it back from me. We definitely got caught in this vicious cycle of trading the lead every 300-400m. This was neither efficient nor did it help us catch up to help Jacob any faster. Now with the finish creeping up on us (1200m to go) I took the lead one final tme from Klaasen. We had not made up enough ground, and I felt like we were beginning to die basically at the same rate as Jacob. It was time to try and salvage the race. I knew that at this point the race was not going to be particularly fast, and that our in-race strategy had been pretty piss-poor, however; I was still determined to make the most of the opportunity to run fast. I remember thinking about this as I took reigns back from Klaasen. It was a substantial move, and nearly as soon as I made it I heard someone shout from the in-field \"No gaps Jason!\". I worried for a second that I had just left Jason out in the cold, but then remembered that this was a now-or-never move and knew that we both had to decide to sink or swim. After 400m of this new pace I felt the moose resume to be my caboose and I was happy that he had the guts to come with me. As I was thinking this with 800m to go the aforementioned runner form SHU went around me at a pretty good clip. I had totally forgotten that he was in the race and honestly had thought that we had dropped him a while ago. This new pace injection was pretty unwelcomed by my body, which makes sense in the last 800m of a 5k. I dug pretty deep to attach myself to this new move but was unsuccessful. I believed at that moment in the race that I didn't have the legs to go quite with it. I did not let him run completely away from me however. I did get dragged along for another lap and with about 600m to go really felt myself hit lactic pretty good. My last lap was nothing too crazy, I definitely had a little bit of a kick but I did not blow the doors off of anyone. I did close the gap on the SHU guy, but did not beat him. I finished probably 5, behind him and maybe 20m or less behind Jacob.\n\nI felt pretty shitty afterwards and I ran around 16:00 for the 5k. Exact times are unknown due to an error in the timing system. Looking back I wish that I had made better in race decisions. The first of these is that I wish I had gone out a little harder. This is definitely not a normal thing for me to write after a race but the logic behind it is this: if I had gone out a little faster I think that I could have run in the pack that Jacob was in. Even if being there doesn't stop him or I from falling back a bit, I would then be in the same situation, just 10 seconds farther up. In addition to this, I could have maybe worked with that pack better anyways, as it was bigger than the one I was in. Basically, I just believe that the opportunity cost of going out maybe 5 seconds faster in the first mile would have been better than hanging back like I chose to. I still want to chew on this one more, even though it looks like I have completely dissected it. This type of failure is making me hungry for another chance to race. Fortunately I will be getting another shot this weekend at Oakland. I cannot keep fucking up like this. I have trained way too hard over the course of five years to only run well at Hillsdale. I will be better at Oakland this weekend because my teammates need me to be, and more importantly, they deserve that I be.","positives":"+Ran well with a teammate\n+Was cognizant of the race situation\n-Need to get better at closing larger gaps and deciding to do so quickly","goal":"I wanted to run close to my PR and I did not do this.

I wanted to really focus on competing and not try to worry about time in an event that is considered to be a little short for me. On top of that, the wind was gusting upwards of 30mph, which wasn't exactly going to make for a PR day.\n\nThe race went off and I immediately snugged my way into the back of our 12 man heat. I really didn't want to take the wind early in the race. Once we hit that first turn, I knew I had made the right decision as the whole pack slowed down noticeably. I could feel wind heavily beating my chest, despite being behind 10 guys. Once around the curve and mostly out of the brunt of the wind the pace seemed to pick back up. We came through 400m in about a 71 I believe. At this point there was already a gap forming in front of me and I knew I had to fill it. This was only a 1500m, so the margin for error was slim. I sat at the back of this new pack for another lap, and we came around through 800 in about 2:22. This is where the pace definitely picked up perceptibly. A new gap had formed, with two guys going out the front of the pack hard. Nobody went with them, and I chose not to as well. I believed that I could close hard, but that making the kind of move with 700m to go would probably be unwise for me. Another 100m later and they had significantly put room on our pack, and I was reassured of my decision to play it cool when they went. 600m left in the race and I was feeling it. My guts hurt, my lungs hurt, and my legs hurt. Truly a triple threated trifecta of pain. This was my race decision moment. I could either fall off the back of my pack, or stick it out. I remembered what I had said to William the previous day. \"Make sure that you make it a race at the end if you want to finish strong\". I grit my teeth and resigned to make it through the wind to the 400m to go mark. I could make this a race. I could. Coming out of the wind and down the straightaway towards the clock I hung tight at the back of our six man pack. The two guys who had gone hard with 700m to go were far and away, and I knew that a move to try to catch them would be pretty foolish and leave me tying up down the home stretch, however; I was determined to finish as high in this heat as possible. Down the back stretch just after 300m to go I made a move past a SVSU guy who was tying up. I snugged back in behind our new smaller pack for the last bend to save myself from the wind again and prepare for an all out throw-down on the home stretch. I came out of the turn wide into lane 3 so that I'd have a clear shot at the line, and shifted into my last gear. I pushed past one guy almost right away. I definitely caught him by surprise, I'm not sure if he actually even knew I was there in the first place. Next on the menu was another SVSU runner. He wasn't going to be passed without a fight but I was simply moving faster than he was. A dork from Red Cedar Running Club (the short one) fell victim to me with about 50m to go as well. I think that this is the 3rd time I've kicked him down in the final 100m of a race. I almost felt bad. Finally I came up on a runner from Detroit Mercy. This guy was hauling, and as soon as I clipped into his periphery he was able to find another gear and hold me off for the remaining 20m.\n\nI was breathing hard and my stomach hurt really bad, but I was pretty proud of that race. I ran tough and was focused on the race situations around me. Most importantly though, I did not put myself out of the race when I wasn't sure I was gonna make it. In fact, I took the risk to put myself right in it and it payed off. I think that this will be huge confidence booster for me going into next week at GVSU where I'll be able to take a shot at the 1500m again with hopefully some better conditions. Rick Otte said that it was the best 1500m he's ever seen me run. He is an honest guy so I appreciated hearing that from him. Shortly after he said that I had to do my best to jog off the infield to puke my brains out :)","positives":"+ finished strong\n+ ran tough in an event that feels fast for me\n- Could have played it a little less safe in the first half","goal":"I wanted to compete in my heat and I definitely achieved that by finishing 3rd overall in it.","turnpoint":"600m left in the race and I was feeling it.

We went out butt-slow after restarting due to a false start (seriously). The first 8 laps or so were led by a scrawny kid from Hope. We clicked 80s as everyone was very content to just relax and make it a race over the last 5k. After two miles Jon got sick of pretenders staying with us and put in a little surge just to shake them, Two laps later they were gone, even though we were still only running 78s. The lead pack of about 10 guys stayed steady for another mile. I got spiked up pretty good from being in such a tight pack. Finally, Beakas (Trine) made a hard move dropping the pace to 75s. Micah and I relaxed, neither of us wanted to make that hard move and we knew that not everyone who had made it would be able to see it through. Sure enough, guys starting comeing back to us. First it was Schloff (Hope). Micah and I made quick work dispatching him even though he tried to stick. We were pretty physical, getting in his space and giving elbows until he was willing to relinquish lane one to us. As soon as he wasn't able to stick to our shoulders, he was out of the race. Next was a kid from Trine. He gave us a lot more trouble. He was a tough son of a gun and kept making what I thought would be his last struggle surge when he would fall off. He kept finding his way back though. Now with three laps to go Micah and I really took it into our final surge. Micah pulled away from me and the Trine kid, which was no surprise as he is a strong runner who's feeling good right now. Two laps later and we were in the final 400m. The Trine kid was wheezing and sounding generally miserable, but I was havinh PTSD like flashbacks to conference last year when I thought a guy was dead but he resurrected himself in the last 100m to hold me off. I allowed to the Trine kid to go around me. I was okay with him determining the pace of the last lap because it meant he would exert himself more than if he was sticking on my back. With 200m to go, I switched gears and cranked around him, getting on my toes and making myself as efficient as my body would let me. With 100m to go I had already gapped him, but I was determined to bring it home strong to the end. 50m to go, and I was closing on Miller from Trine, who I didn't know was dying so hard.

First few miles felt a little harder than they should. Still with the top group through 3 miles, then I decided to gradually let them go so i wouldn't blow up later in the race.

Caught Heinzman and tried to move back to Fred while dropping the Wartburg guys, but Fred was making a hard move after Caleb already. The gap to Fred just got wider while I tried to deal with Hoffman. Eventually put a hard surge on him when I could tell he was in a rough patch and dropped him pretty hard. 53:40 was 34 seconds slower than last year, but I have tons of excuses that might also be valid reasons why it was slower, but most of it was just I didn't move with Fred on the hill like I should have.","positives":"One of my most efficient races.

Next time Im going to follow through on that. I have to. so I needed to maintain focus better there. Caught Addy and tried to get him to come with to Pettinga, but he didn't respond.

I was feeling good where I was at, and I wasn't sure If I should catch up with them or not, so I stayed put where I was at. I figured that I was comfortable enough to catch them whenever I chose to, or try to go with them if they started to push later in the race. I was still feeling really relaxed around the 3-mile mark. We came up to the last uphill before the turnaround and I sort of just let my eyes drop. I would think that would've been bad, but when I got to the top of the hill a while later and looked up I was only a few steps behind Jason. I stayed about 10 meters behind him the entire downhill. As soon as we rounded the corner at the halfway point, I popped up next to him. As soon as we were next to each other, we both drastically increased our pace trying to catch Addy and Micah. We quickly caught them, but maintained pace, trying to pull them with us. Micah came with us, and the three of us kept the pace until we caught Pettinga. At that point, Jason dropped off a little, Pettinga didn't come with us, and Micah and I kept the pace up for a while. I stayed right on Micah's heels for about a mile before he increased his pace and took off about a half-mile from the top of the hill. I was left in a bit of a hole and had nobody to pace with for a while. I just tried to maintained pace for as long as I could. Right before the top of the hill, Jason caught up to me. I went with him for 20 steps or so, but he had just picked the pace up so much I was way out of my comfort zone. I pushed the pace fast as I could down the hill, however, I think the downhill gave me a lot of energy back. Right after the downhill was the last corner and straightaway.

Yeah it was a tough course, but that doesn't warrant the race that I ran. I should have been able to do more and help the team. As for my season, I honestly didn't think it was good either. I'll explain: Knight Invite - Yeah, I worked up to some varsity guys in the second half and that was fun, but really my time was only five seconds faster than it was my freshman year. Everyone thought I ran so well when really it was simply ok. Lansing - I was slower this year with better conditions. I was slower at Muskegon too. I may have got \"runner of the week\" here and a 5k win there, but honestly my season was rather lackluster. I didn't go under 27:00 a single time this season, but I did last year as a Freshman. Believe it or not my fastest race this year was the first one at Hope. I don't really know what to make of all of it. I wanted to be so much better this season and make big steps. I really looked up to what Charlie was able to do last season on D-squad and thought I could maybe try to do the same.

He probably saw how bad I looked and wisely moved ahead, his eyes on getting up to Fred. (2) The big hill on the back part came and that didn't go to well either. My pace was horribly slowed for several hundred meters after and I couldn't seem to get any momentum whatsoever.

I felt like I was in the right spot. I liked that Derek, Clinton, and I could work together for the first part. I ended up dropping out somewhere around 5K because my back was tightening up and I didn't want to throw away my season in the first race. It started tightening up in the first 1K but I didn't think much of it since it was a little sore earlier in the week. Around maybe 4K it had tightened up more and was starting to bother me but still wasn't painful. Besides that I feel like I was running okay. There was definitely a mental struggle with the back near the end of my race.","positives":"Positive: The race had a good start. Negative: The middle miles hurt and I think I could have handled them better because my body besides the back was feeling good. The mental part was challenging with thinking about my back for my last kilometer of the race.

Definitely one of my most painful races. Also definitely put too much pressure on myself this race compared to others this season. Two of my best races ever (Big Meet 5k, Hillsdale 5k) came from extreme pressure on myself, but many very good races (GV Mile, Notre Dame) came from just going out there and enjoying the competition and not worrying about anything else. Got out super well in the first 400m. Quick off the line and maintained my space, but I had to wait and look around a lot until someone finally caught up to me to run with. Then I didn't maneuver as well as Brandan or Micah in the first mile, I didn't follow close enough to take advantage of the lanes they found, which really messed up my race plan of running with them since I had to try to euro step and bully my way up to them spending too much energy. I was hurting a lot in mile two and lost a lot of spots, but recovered and pushed miles 3 and 4 with Pettinga and Will. The last mile was pretty rough, but I found some more gears with 700 to go and kicked pretty hard, nobody near me outkicked me.","positives":"Another strong finishing kick. I'm excited that I can rely on my kick inside the last kilometer/600m of a race. That'll be something I can use at Conference, that I just need to stay close until I can kick. Lol, that's not normally something I would have said about myself. The second mile was a really rough patch. If I could have stuck it through there, I think this would have been on par with Notre Dame.","goal":"No, I wanted to run with Brandan and Micah in the front of our chase pack, but I just wasn't careful about my position relative to them as I should have been.

We came through exactly as we had planned and saved a lot of energy for the second half of the race.","positives":"I think my two biggest positives were 1). How relaxed I was for the first 2K, and 2). My pace over the last 5K, and how strong I felt. I felt like I was just grinding it out, not really having to push myself to the red line to keep going. I think I need to work a little on my racing though. I felt like I just raced myself the whole race. While I'm OK with that, I don't feel like I'm actually passing anyone, because nobody I pass tries to come with me and the other runners running my pace are too far up in the race for me to catch. I am not sure what to do in this situation. On top of that, I don't think it would be better for the team if I went out any faster, I enjoy running with Micah and Will and I do think our current race strategy Benefits all of us a ton.","goal":"I did achieve what I set out to do, which was setting another PR. The goal was definitely realistic, but I do feel that it would've been better to try to aim to close the gap on Ryan more.","turnpoint":"Big turning point was right at the start of the race. The three of us stayed within ourselves very well for the first 3K, but that was mainly because we held each other together from the start. Each of us verbally made sure that we stayed on pace, and that we kept relaxed and together. Without the relaxed first two miles of the race, I have no idea how it would've gone. My second turning point was at the 3K we began to pick up the pace. I felt really relaxed, and over the next 1K I felt like I was continuously accelerating. Picking the pace up then was almost perfect, because I didn't settle into a group until after the 7K when other runners started their finishing sprint.","attitude":"10","effort":"7","date":"1570507820804","season":"XC 2019"},{"ID":"Tommy NobleJayhawk invite1570910771839","name":"Tommy Noble","meet":"Jayhawk invite","event":"8k","thoughts":"Brutal conditions, but yet another PR, ran about 20 seconds faster than I did at Lansing.

Caleb's inhaler worked for me much better than my inhaler last week. This race went quite a bit better than last week. Sat behind my guys for the first mile like we planned so that I can work in the second half. Felt pretty easy, thought I was going through in 5:20 low, but ended up like 5:31 lol that's so slow. Freaked out a little, but just kept moving through the field. Then through 2 miles in 10:58, then I was like ok time to actually move going into the last full loop. I tried to be as efficient as possible while passing all these dying people, but there just wasn't a good way to do it without contact or bad lines/bad tangents. Most of the time I chose contact or near contact, which I think was more efficient than swinging wide every turn. Eventually caught Micah with half a mile to go after a big effort to close the gap a mile before. Brandan did it and then some and made it look easy. Micah then dragged me home to finish line and I finished a step behind kicking down 2 dudes right at the line.

In essence, my body gradually depleted everything. I started out strong, but way too excited since I ran 25 seconds faster than what I wanted to open in the first mile. I was tanked by about 5k and the rest of the race, to put it simply, was a disaster. My vision started to go out, I lost orientation and if it weren't for the extremely well marked out course with thousands of orange flags leading the way, I would've been completely lost. The hills I remember were the toughest parts by far. It would wipe out whatever strength I had left. The finish was what ended everything, almost literally.

I'm most happy about that mainly because I'd never felt so winded during a race before. I am also very satisfied with my mental state heading into the race. I felt I prepared well and was ready to race hard. The thing I need to work on most is gaining 8K racing wisdom and experience. I really should've saved more for a finishing kick.","goal":"I did achieve what I set out to do. I felt like I ran with stronger form than I ever did in high school, and really stayed on the gas hard even as I started to burn out at the end.","turnpoint":"My biggest turning point during the race was when I felt Micah start to separate from the pack and chase down some of the leaders. I wasn't completely sure if I was prepared do go with him at that point in the race, but I jumped in with him anyways, and we started trailing right behind the 2nd - 5th group of guys. I think my choice put me where I wanted to be, But I think I could've run a faster time and finished higher if I would've chosen to hang back a little longer and save some energy for the last 3k.","attitude":"9","effort":"10","date":"1568086085983","season":"XC 2019"},{"ID":"Caleb FergusonOsh-Kosh Kollege Town Invite1571667640029","name":"Caleb Ferguson","meet":"Osh-Kosh Kollege Town Invite","event":"8k","thoughts":"this was a huge disappointment for me personally.

Overall happy with how it went, i went into it with the mindset of running within myself the first half to make sure i was able to have a solid strong second half and i think i was able to achieve that. It was also fun to pack up with the other calvin guys in my heat and be able to race with and help each other. ","positives":"Had a good finish and ran the race pretty evenly. I think i did a good job of not getting ahead of myself at the beginning and running faster than i could sustain. I think i also did a good job at starting my kick at a good time and finishing strong. Something to work on would be trusting my training a bit more early on and not be afraid to help support my teammates right off the bat instead of taking it out more conservatively ","goal":"I think i achieved what i set out to do. I went into the race wanting to run smart and even as well as have a solid second half and I think i did just that.

All in all it was a solid way to start my season considering that my preparation for the meet and season was only 12 days following my sickness.","positives":"My two biggest positives came in my attitude to run through the pack, and discontinue any thoughts about being behind in miles or still sick. I also felt like I fought really well through the race. Even though I died about 1500 or 1600m in I still felt I managed to keep contact with the race and with the reality that I needed to provide myself a realistic starting point for my season. I feel that the best way to improve going forward is to ensure that I carefully keep increasing my mileage as the intensity increases. I don't want to miss out on any of the needed base miles to support such a long season.","goal":"I wanted to stick with the pack and run the time that I was recommended. Al convinced me over the last few days that I could surprise myself, and even though I believed that wholeheartedly, I don't think that I could've changed anything to get to those goals. I feel the reality is that I need more miles, and my durability and endurance needs to be rebuilt following my bout with influenza. I feel I need to get my body back to a certain standard before I let my mind run over what I can do. The reality is that it doesn't matter how strong my mentality is, I won't be able to chase down strong runners if I'm running on weak legs.","turnpoint":"I was sitting in back for the start of the race, trying to save up my energy. I knew that I was going to have to move through the pack at the end of the race, so at the 1000m I made the move. When I made the move I was fully confident that I could hold the increase in pace through to the end of the race, however my second big turning point was when I realized my head was ahead of my body, and I died 1200m ahead of where I thought I would.
