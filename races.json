[{"ID":"Jason KlaassenUBH Invitational1586715583153","name":"Jason Klaassen","meet":"UBH Invitational","event":"1500m","group":"Distance","thoughts":"Ran 4:18 (4:37 mile). Got out well in 65 right behind Addy and Ty. Then the next lap still felt pretty hard, but Addy and I ran a fucking 72. Changed gears pretty hard and tried to catch Ty. Still ran pretty slow for the last 700m despite feeling like I was really hauling.","positives":"Confident and smooth and relaxed early.\nResponded well and stayed engaged on the second half extremely well.\n\nI should have moved up a lot earlier when I started to feel a little too good in the second lap.","goal":"Well the goal was sub4:10, but given Ty ran 4:16 I think this was a really good effort for me. First time beating Addy since our first race ever together. I'm in really good shape right now","turnpoint":"2:17 at 800 - Change gears and compete\n3:10 at 400m to go - Try to catch Ty","attitude":"9","effort":"9","date":"1586715599761","season":"Corona 2020"}]
